# API Collections Repository

This repository contains four sets of APIs. Each collection is uploaded in a separate file in the main branch. These collections can be used for testing or developing various API services.

## Collections

1. **Grocery Store API**
   - This file contains the **Grocery Store Mock API** that you can use to simulate an online grocery store.
   - You can use this API to simulate operations such as adding products to the cart, viewing products, and more.

2. **MockAPI**
   - This file contains a **MockAPI** that allows you to generate fake data for testing applications or APIs without needing a real server.
   - You can use it to generate random data such as users, products, comments, etc.

3. **Request.in API**
   - This file contains the **Request.in API**, a tool that allows you to test APIs by creating links for sending and receiving data.
   - You can use it to test HTTP requests and API tools in a simulated environment.

4. **Simple Book API**
   - This file contains the **Simple Book API**, which provides access to book data like title, author, and description.
   - It can be used to test or experiment with organizing and retrieving book data via APIs.
